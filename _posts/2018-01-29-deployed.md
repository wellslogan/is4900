It took me a while to get the build to actually deploy properly, but I did it! A preliminary version of the front end NEU Restroom Review site (powered by React, source code [available here](https://github.com/wellslogan/rr-neu-site){:target="_blank"})
is now [successfully deployed on heroku](https://rr-neu-site.herokuapp.com){:target="_blank"}. I prioritized getting this deployed over the API so that I can get some quick feedback on the UX for the site - even though it's pretty straightforward, you never know what feedback you can get.

I should note that there're no API calls getting made here - just a quick demo using the browser Geolocate API and some mock data.
