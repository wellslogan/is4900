# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: Requirements & Use Cases

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
# description: >
#   Description goes here

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.
image: /assets/img/default.jpg

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [project]
tags: [project, update]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

I wanted to very clearly document the requirements and use cases for the RR site before I went any further with development. I feel as though I have added many of the core requirements and use cases for the site now, so I am more comfortable going forward with the API development.

I want to work through some prototypes for the front-end design. I am not a graphic designer, so I am going to keep it simple - likely a single search box allowing the user to enter a location (or have it autofilled if the user allows - I made sure to add a requirement that enforces the fact that the user doesn't need to provide their location for the site to be useful). 

Another thing I am thinking about - publicity. I'm not sure how I want to share the site once it is live. In one of the articles I read about crowdsourcing data they talk about the intial user base being extremely important since it will eventually drop off, and I want to collect as much data as possible. I'm thinking of posting at least on the Northeastern subreddit - there are a fair number of subscribers there and I think it could potentially get some attention on there.
