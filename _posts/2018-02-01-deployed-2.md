In my last post I had just managed to get the front end site deployment working - now I'm happy to say that I've got all three parts of this system - front end, API, and DB up and running! You can take them for a spin right now over at [https://rr-neu-site.herokuapp.com](https://rr-neu-site.herokuapp.com){:target="_blank"}. 

It's somewhat barebones right now, the main functionality that I've got working is the ability to get your approximate address from your current position using the Google Geocoding API, but you can also view (and add!) Restrooms in the database. Next on the agenda - adding a reviews component to the API and building out the UI for that. Authentication is a must as well; going to have to at least add a Google reCaptcha challenge to the Add Room page in the interim so I don't blow through my DB capacity.
