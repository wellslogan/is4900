The Restroom Review (RR) site will collect and provide crowdsourced data on public restrooms (initially limited to just those at Northeastern University in Boston, MA). The site will allow authenticated users (authenticated using Google as an identity provider - see [User Authentication](#user-authentication)) to identify and submit reviews for restrooms on campus. Unauthenticated users will be able to view reviews but must authenticate before they can leave reviews or ratings of their own.
