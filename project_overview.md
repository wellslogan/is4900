## Project Description
<p class="message">
<strong>Crowdsourcing</strong> noun crowd·sourc·ing \ ˈkrau̇d-ˌsȯr-siŋ \<br/>
The practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers.

The goal of this project is to explore the power of crowdsourced data, and the ethics of collecting it, through the lens of a specific web application which collects data in this way.

The Restroom Review (RR) website allows users to find and rate public restrooms near them. By browsing to the site on a mobile device, and allowing the site to use their location, they can see restrooms around them that have been reported and rated/reviewed by other users. Users can sort the restrooms by distance or rating, and they can also leave reviews or ratings themselves. If they've found a restroom that has not previously been reported, they can submit it to the site. 

This poses interesting ethical questions, though. Consider the case where a user posts a restroom which is not public, or which is not known to be explictly public. Or, what happens when a particular business owner has a public restroom onsite, but after increased visibility due to the website, decides to restrict its use to paying customers only? 

Another interesting idea is the ability for this "repository" of data is whether it can be self-correcting. In other words, if one or two users leave incorrect or misleading reviews, can additional reviews come in that "drown out" the bad information?

## Specific Aims
- Investigate literature surrounding the collection of crowdsourced data.
- Investigate attitudes surrounding collection of crowdsourced data.
- Build a functional Restroom Review site that allows users to find and submit known public restrooms to the site database, as well as leave ratings or reviews for those restrooms.
- Build a user base of people who regularly access the site, in order to collect crowdsourced data that other users can utilize.
- Understand ethical concerns about crowdsourcing data in this fashion.

## Research Question(s)
Can crowdsourcing accurately build a repository of data in a way that is self-correcting and ethical.

## Investigating Attitudes
In order to investigate attitudes towards crowdsourced review data, and towards a Restroom Review site like mine, I have put together [a survey](https://goo.gl/forms/0scHG2YhYkEXqbry2){:target="_blank"} which I plan to pilot test and administer. For convenience I've copied the questions below:

None of the responses are required.

1. Demographic: Gender
1. Demographic: Age
1. How often do you contribute to crowdsourced data, e.g. leaving a review for a product, reviewing a restaurant, reviewing an app, etc?
1. How often do you access crowdsourced data, e.g. reading reviews for a product, reading reviews for a restaurant, reading reviews for an app, etc?
1. For each of the following, rate your level of agreement
  - I consider reviews to be crowdsourced data
  - I never leave reviews for anything unless I have a problem
  - I look at reviews for products even when I'm shopping in a store
  - Reviews are the primary factor in determining what I buy and which restaurants I go to
  - I don't think reviews are very helpful
  - I don't trust reviews to always be factual or genuine
  - I have been dishonest in a review that I've left

(Now imagine that there is a website that lets you review and look at reviews for restrooms on the Northeastern Campus.)
1. What is the likelihood you would use such a site?
1. How often would you use such a site?
1. When reading a review for a restroom, what factors would you consider highly?
